# Fun Fact
This is a simple application built using Swift 3, XCode, and MVC, or Model View, Controller design approach. The application simply helps the student learn more about how the user interface interacts with the implementation code. This application was built with guidance from the Team Tree House[https://teamtreehouse.com/]

After implementing the implication which displays static facts, it has been updated to display random facts retrieved from the http://numbersapi.com/ API. Upon launch, after tapping the 'Show Another Fun Fact', it will make a request to the server for a random fact.
